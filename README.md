# Thesis_2025
This repo contains all files and code mentioned in my MSEE thesis, "Physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) Layer Protocol Vulnerability Analysis in 5G New Radio (NR)."

The MATLAB Code is based upon "NRMIBandSIB1RecoveryExample" from Mathworks. Python code is courtesy of Dr. John D. Roth. All credit due to authors of "From 5G Sniffing to Harvesting Leakages from Privacy Preserving Messengers."
The 5GSniffer is open sourced at https://github.com/spritelab/5GSniffer. What we refer to as "Capture 1" is their example IQ file, which has download instructions at the URL given.

Capture 2 is provided in .dat and .mat format, RACH_cap4_sc16.dat and RACH_cap4.mat
Capture 3 is provided in .dat and .mat format, RACH_cap1_10MHz_sc16.dat and RACH_10MHz_cap1.mat
